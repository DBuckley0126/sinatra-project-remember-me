<p>You understand that the use of the Skill is voluntary. By using the Remember Me Skill on Amazon's Alexa service on any Alexa-enabled device (e.g., Amazon Echo) you can use voice commands to communicate with us regarding your Account and other features enabled by the Skill. Your communication with Remember Me using the Alexa service constitutes an authorized communication by you. You are solely responsible for all communications with Remember Me using the Remember Me Skill. Please ensure that others do not interact with Remember Me via the Skill on your behalf, and, if you do not want to be overheard, ensure that you are out of earshot when interacting with Remember Me via the Skill. It is possible that Alexa (and the equipment Alexa is installed on) and/or Amazon will record your interactions with the Skill or with Alexa. Consult your agreements with Amazon for more details about how interactions are treated by Amazon and your Alexa-enabled device.</p>

<p>Remember Me and its affiliates may collect, store, and use, and direct a third party collect, store, and use, collected information. Any collected information that constitutes personally identifiable information is governed by Remember Me privacy policy, as it may be updated from time to time.

By installing the Skill, you are authorizing Remember Me to perform the actions and/or share with Amazon the information communicated to Remember Me, or requested from Remember Me. The interactions you have with the Skill take place through Amazon. For example, if you ask Alexa for information tied to your account, Remember Me transmits the relevant information through Amazon. Therefore, you hereby authorize Remember Me to share that information with Amazon in response to your interactions with the Skill.</p>

<p>Alexa and your Alexa-enabled device were not designed or manufactured by Remember Me, and Remember Me does not have control over the software that runs on the device, which includes other third party applications. Alexa may not function without error, and may incorrectly process words, conduct translations, or give responses.

Remember Me does not warrant that the functionality or operation of the Skill will be uninterrupted or free from error that any defects in the Skill will be corrected, or that the Skill or the servers that make it available are free of viruses or other harmful conditions or components. The Skill may occasionally be restricted, interrupted, or discontinued due to various conditions, including without limitation Skill design, network coverage, government regulation, and situations beyond Remember Me’s control. Neither Remember Me nor its affiliates, suppliers, nor will have any liability to you for any losses suffered as a result of that arise out of or in connection with your use of the Skill.

<p>Once you set up your Alexa device with the Skill, you are authorizing Remember Me to provide information to the device based on the device's security settings. For example, the settings on your device may allow the device to retrieve information about your Account(s) based on only verbal requests from anyone who uses your device, or to save information about your Account(s) for easier access. By enabling the Skill on your Alexa-enabled device, you are responsible for how the Skill is used (including any communication to or from Remember Me from your device).</p>

<p>To the extent permitted by law, Remember Me and its affiliates, suppliers, and licensors are not liable for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, punitive, or consequential loss or damage arising out of or in connection with the device or your use of the Skill (including without limitation the input of personally identifiable and other information into the Skill), whether the claim is based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, and even if Remember Me has express knowledge of the possibility of such loss or damage. You shall not seek to recover any damages (including without limitation direct, consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages) from Remember Me, its affiliates, suppliers, or licensors outside of the conditions set forth in these Terms. You must file any lawsuit or other action directed against Remember Me, its affiliates, suppliers, or licensors within one year after the date of the event that caused the loss or damage.</p>

<p>You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Remember Me, its affiliates, suppliers, and licensors from and against all claims, losses, damages, and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with your use of the device or Skill or your violation of these Terms.</p>

<p>The Skill is controlled and operated in the United Kingdom. This agreement is governed by and interpreted according to the law within United Kingdom, excluding that body of law applicable to conflicts of law.</p>

<p>If any provision of this agreement is held invalid, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be considered severable from the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Remember Me’s failure to enforce any right or provision in this agreement will not constitute a waiver of such provision, or any other provision in these Terms.</p>
